# Content: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
## Project: Grouping customers based on their features
### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook file. The `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset file has the required data.
### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory that contains this README and run the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook Mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb 
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
